The Wildest Party Game You've Ever Played

"Would You Rather - Dirty Adult" isn’t your grandma’s party game. It's bold. It's spicy. It's completely unfiltered. Whether you're at a wild house party, a cozy game night with close friends, or even vibing with strangers you’ll never see again (no judgment), this game guarantees one thing: absolute chaos and unforgettable memories.


1400+ Outrageous, Bold Questions

Think you're prepared? Think again. With over 1400 jaw-dropping dilemmas across hilarious, hot, and "I can’t believe I just said that" categories, you’ll dive into choices that are funny, naughty, and definitely not safe for work.
No two games are ever the same — every round promises new surprises and even bigger laughs.


NSFW Hot and Spicy Game Modes

Choose your level of boldness. From “starter pack” to “dirty secrets,” our NSFW game modes let you dial up (or down) the heat depending on your vibe. Perfect for breaking the ice, flirting dangerously, or just causing pure, glorious chaos among your bravest friends.

This game is NOT for the shy or the overly innocent.
It’s for the bold, the fearless, and the ones who are ready to reveal way too much information without blinking.
Think you know your friends? Play a few rounds and you’ll find out who’s secretly a saint... and who’s absolutely not.

Disclaimer

We take zero responsibility for broken trust, ruined reputations, surprise hook-ups, sudden crushes, or any "I can't believe you said that" moments. Play at your own risk — and don’t say we didn’t warn you.
